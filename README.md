# Weakly Supervised Occupancy Prediction using  Residential Training Data Collected via Interactive Learning
## abstract
Accurate and timely occupancy prediction has the potential to improve the efficiency of energy management systems in smart buildings. Occupancy prediction heavily depends on historical occupancy-related data collected from various sensor sources.  Unfortunately, a major problem in that context is the difficulty to collect training data. This situation inspired us to rethink the occupancy prediction problem by proposing an original principled approach for occupancy training data collection based on occupancy estimation via an interactive learning approach. Then, various features and algorithms were used to forecast future occupancy. This paper proposes a weakly supervised occupancy prediction framework based on office sensor readings and occupancy estimations derived from an interactive-learning approach. Extensive simulations were performed to show the merits and investigate the performance of the proposed prediction framework, and to corroborate the interactive-learning-based approach's ability to contribute to the achievement of effective occupancy prediction.
